		<h2 class="text-center">What I've been up to at Etsy</h2>
	</div>

	<div class="sm-col-10 md-col-7 lg-col-6 px2 mx-auto">		
		<p> Here's a selection of work from my time at Etsy. As is the case with many companies and projects, it's really hard for me to take sole credit for any of this work because I've been part of some extremely talented teams. I've worked on two main projects during my time at Etsy: search and the Etsy app.</p>
		<p>Let's talk search first.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="sm-col-10 md-col-7 lg-col-6 px1 mx-auto">		
		<p> Imagine a library with 45 million books, but instead of books with accurate metadata from a publisher, the information was submitted by 1.8 million different people, and each person provided information using varied categories. To make things more interesting, your job as a librarian is to catalog the books for your 29.7 million patrons. That scenario maps pretty well to my job as lead product designer on search at Etsy. Trying to understand and organize those 45 million listings is what I've been up to for a majority of my 3.5 years there.</p>
		<p> I have worked on this project from a handful of different angles, but the main focuses have been to create an understandable UI backed by qualitative and quantitative research, work with other parts of the company in getting more structured and accurate metadata from sellers while working with our taxonomists in organizing the inventory, and guide users to what they are looking for through filters and other means.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="sm-col-10 md-col-7 lg-col-6 px2 pt3 pb1 mx-auto">		
		<p> Here's what search looked like when I started working at Etsy.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="sm-col-10 md-col-7 lg-col-6 px2 pt4 mt2 pb2 mx-auto">		
		<p> I started by updating the search results page to feel more like the other main pages on Etsy's site. After conducting some user research and testing, I also updated the UI of several search filters.</p>
	</div>

	<img class="img-shadow block mx-auto my-2" src="/images/e/mid-search.jpg" width="700">

	<div class="sm-col-10 md-col-7 lg-col-6 px2 pt4 mt2 pb2 mx-auto">		
		<p> The next step was to make search more responsive by taking better advantage of different screen sizes. To make this happen, I worked very closely with engineers and together we rewrote all of the legacy HTML and CSS on the search page using Etsy's new CSS tool kit.</p>
	</div>

	<img class="img-shadow block mx-auto my-2" src="/images/e/full-search.jpg" width="700">

	<div class="sm-col-10 md-col-7 lg-col-6 px2 pt4 mt2 pb2 mx-auto">		
		<p> I spend a good chunk of my time working to understand the difference between low-, medium-, and high-intent queries and understand how we could create different and more tailored experiences in each case.</p>
		<p class="mt1"> One example of a low-intent query is the below design where the visual treatment is still in flux, but the product side has proved to be a win. The short summary is that when a user enters a query, we run a few calculations about the diversity of the result set between categories to determine the intent of the search. If it's proven to be low-intent, we show a group of selected subcategories that help the user dive in further to narrow down the search. I have a lot of unreleased work pertaining to this track of work.</p> 
	</div>

	<div class="sm-col-10 md-col-7 lg-col-6 px2 pt4 mt2 pb2 mx-auto">		
		<p> Currently, I am working on improving the filters for Etsy. We have started adding query-specific filters in different verticals.</p>

		<p> I also worked on these features at the same time for all sizes of Android, iOS, and mobile web. Below you can see mobile web versions from when I started versus current iterations. I've spent a lot of time working on and updating the listing card along with other IA choices.</p>

		<p> Here is some of the work on search I did in the app a couple of years ago. </p>

	<div class="sm-col-10 md-col-7 lg-col-6 px2 pt4 mt2 pb2 mx-auto">		
		<p> I've also worked on the category pages for Etsy, finding and trying to streamline the other ways in which buyers can be connected with items in which they're interested.</p>
	</div>

	<img class="img-shadow block mx-auto my-2" src="/images/e/category.jpg" width="700">

	<div class="sm-col-10 md-col-7 lg-col-6 px2 pt4 mt2 pb2 mx-auto">		
		<p>I could talk about search on Etsy and post screenshots for hours, but I also spent about 7 months as the only designer working on the Etsy app. During this time I aligned all of the visual design of the app with a new style guide. This included updating colors, typography, icons, and layouts. In between this work I was also working on small features and experiments to improve both the iOS and Android experiences.</p>

		<p> I spent a good chunk of time trying to find ways to add delight to our app through motion. I would work very closely with our engineers and build prototypes with them. The below example shows when we were considering ways to make transitions between views in the app more seamless.</p>

		<p> I also did a lot of work considering the future of the Etsy app. Working with our research team to create empathy maps, building prototypes, and envisioning what the future could look like. I ultimately can't share this work at this time.</p>

	<div class="sm-col-10 md-col-7 lg-col-6 px2 pt4 mt2 pb2 mx-auto">		
		<p> Beyond the app and search, I've done many one-off projects, from working on our category navigation and updating listing cards throughout the site, to creating marketing pages for different events and initiatives.</p>
