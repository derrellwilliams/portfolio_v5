copy: As I had never been to the Catskills, we decided our next mini trip would be up to check out the locally famous Kaaterskill Falls and then find a cool trail to hike and find somewhere to camp. The first stop, Kaaterskill Falls, was a set of two waterfalls, whose height reaches 260 feet, which puts them near the top of the tall waterfalls in New York and even puts them in the running for tallest in the entire east coast. Washington Irving mentioned these falls in his famous story Rip Van Winkle, and they've basically been popular ever since. Even when it was 50 degrees out and cloudly we ran into about 15 other people on the trail so expect some crowds as it's pretty easy to get to, about .5 miles each way, and about an 45min-60min round trip.<br><br> After checking out all the trails around the Falls, we decided there wasn't really a good option as the upper trail above the falls was fenced off due to a few accidents that resulted in fatalties over the summer, so we decided to drive about a mile farther down the road closer to North and South Lake and started up the Escarpment Trail. We found overnight parking at the beginning of Scutt Road which is right where the Escarpment starts, just north of the lot with the Blue Blazes. It was a pretty moderate hike passing things like Laymans Monument, and a handful of overlook ledges, like Inspiration Point. It was after the last ledge that we turned off the trail and hiked up to a flatter section of ground to setup camp. In the Catskills you are allowed to backcountry camp anywhere 150 feet from trails or water so that makes it pretty easy and takes away the stress of some of the areas close to NYC.<br><br>After cooking some dinner and messing around a bit it started to gently snow, which we thought would never stick this early in the season, but by the time we woke up in the morning we had a couple of inches of snow and quite a bit of ice on the tent. We were a tad worried the blazes would be covered with snow on our return, but they were still visible as we made our way back to Scutt Road.<br><br> You can see a trail map <a href="http://www.greatnortherncatskills.com/files/public/KRTmaps-combined_5_14_13.jpg"> here</a> for the area. The total mileage on the section loop we did back to Scutt road is in the 2-3 mile range, but the entire Escarpment trail is 23.9 miles and could be a great full weekend trip (See that route <a href="http://www.cnyhiking.com/EscarpmentTrail.htm">here</a>.)<br><br> <iframe src="https://mapsengine.google.com/map/u/1/embed?mid=z28a7VabHV-8.kQTw0QLfp7cE" width="100%" height="350"></iframe>
