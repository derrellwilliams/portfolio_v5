copy: Over the winter I heard about a trail in the Catskill Mountains that was dubbed "The hardest trail in the Northeast" by the New York Times. That description obviously caught my attention, especially my West Coast pride that thought hikes out here couldn't be terribly tough, seeing as nothing even gets above the elevation of an average city in the Wasatch or the Front Range. After reading up on it for a bit, I found out the trail was about 25 miles long with about 15K feet of elevation gain. (I actually found mixed reports ranging from 8k to 18k, but 15k sounds pretty good since we didn't track it.) That made it sound pretty terrible, so I figured we probably ought to do it. <br><br>Nicole, Dennis and I decided to hike it over a rainy weekend when we couldn't climb or bike much. The main thing we had trouble coming up with was a shuttle back to our car. Devil's Path is a thru-hike, and since we live in Manhattan and none of us have cars (and we didn't want to rent two) we decided we'd leave a bike at the end of the trail to ride back. The problem there was we knew it was going to rain all weekend and we didn't want to leave our nicer bikes locked to some tree in the rain. Nicole offered her tiny single speed for transporation.<br><br>We started hiking at around 11am from the Prediger Road Trailhead on a Saturday. The actual hike started out fairly easy as we summited Indian Head, the first of six peaks. We then spent the next seven hours or so making our way over four more of the peaks before we stopped at the Devil's Acre lean-to about 16 miles in to sleep.<br><br>The next morning we woke up early and finished the final nine miles, getting to the Spruceton Road Trailhead just after 1pm. Dennis rode the stashed bike to the starting point and drove the car back.<br><br>The actual trail was super easy to follow and I don't think we really got off track the entire time. There are red blazes and a clear path marking the entire trail. We had a couple of downpours, so the rocky downclimbs actually ended up being the toughest parts. There weren't any injuries, but we all had a few falls on our butts on the slick sections. Although the scenery was beautiful, by the time we got to Spruceton Road Trailhead we all felt like we'd filled our quota for thru-hikes for a while.<br><br><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=z28a7VabHV-8.kLDD0Yxfc66k" width="100%" height="480"></iframe>
