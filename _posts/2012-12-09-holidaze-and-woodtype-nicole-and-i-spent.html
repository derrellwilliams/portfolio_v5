<h3>holidaze and woodtype</h3>
<p>Nicole and I spent yesterday at my old place of employment, Hemmert Studios, where they graciously let us mess around with some odds and ends of a few incomplete wood type families. We could only find one &#8220;Y&#8221; from another face, among other issues, as you can see. But that&#8217;s kinda what we like about old wood type. It&#8217;s always nice to get off the ol&#8217; computer and get ink all over ourselves.</p>
We also had a pair of 3D glasses, so we were attempting to get three dimensional on one of the prints. Not sure if we succeeded there — when you put on the glasses it&#8217;s mostly just blurry. </div>
