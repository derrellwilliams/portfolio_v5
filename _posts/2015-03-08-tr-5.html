copy: After spending almost every weekend this winter at ski resorts in the NYC/VT area, we decided to mix things up and do a bit of exploring. We got wind of a cool place in the Catskills called Bearpen Mountain that we could hike and ski, so we rented a car and headed up. <br><br> It turns out that Bearpen Mountain has quite the history. In the mid-1950's there was the beginning of a ski resort here, "The Princeton Snow Bowl at Bearpen Mountain." It had a lift and towrope, and things were looking up for a resort in the area. The mountain has more vertical drop (2100' overall) and  more snow then any of the other resorts in the area, not to mention it faces northeast. The resort had four or five good ski seasons, and had the most skiable days in the East for most of those. After some land ownership disputes, construction halted and the dreams of a resort there died off. (Read more about this story <a href="http://skikabbalah.com/lostNY/bearpen/BEARPEN%20STORY.htm">here</a>.) <br><br> The route we took starts at the end of Heisinger Road, with a very visibly marked logging road to the left that we followed all the way up to the summit. It was around three miles to the top, with around a 10%-ish grade. We encountered a handful of relics from its past on the way up, like tow rope engines, old ski signs, and an old truck from the early 50's. I'm thinking it might be time to restart this resort up again :)<br><br> <iframe src="https://mapsengine.google.com/map/u/1/embed?mid=z28a7VabHV-8.kLVxCc-t81Xo" width="640" height="360"></iframe>
