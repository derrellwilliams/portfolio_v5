copy: We have been at the ski resorts in the NYC/VT area almost every weekend this winter and decided to switch things up a bit and do a bit of exploring. We got wind of a cool place in the Catskills that we could hike and ski, so we rented a car and headed up. <br><br> It turns out that Bearpen Mountain has quite the history. In the mid 1950's there was the beginning of a ski resort here, "The Princeton Snow Bowl at Bearpen Mountain", and it had lift and towrope, and things were looking up for a resort in the area. It has more vertical drop (2100" overall) and  more snow then any of the other resorts in the area, not to mention it faces Northeast. They had 4 or 5 good ski seasons, and had the most skiable days in the East for most of those. After some land ownership issues, construction halted and the dreams of a resort there died off. (Read more about this story <a href="http://skikabbalah.com/lostNY/bearpen/BEARPEN%20STORY.htm">here</a>.) <br><br> The route we took starts right at the end of Heisinger Road, with a very visibly marked logging road to the left that we followed all the way up to the summit. We encountered a handful of relics from it's past. Tow rope engines, old ski signs, and an old truck from the early 50's. I'm thinking we should restart this resort up :)<br><br> <iframe src="https://mapsengine.google.com/map/u/1/embed?mid=z28a7VabHV-8.kLVxCc-t81Xo" width="640" height="360"></iframe>
