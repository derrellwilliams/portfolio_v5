<p>I ran across an interesting <a href="http://www.quora.com/Designers/Why-is-there-such-a-stunningly-short-supply-of-designers-in-Silicon-Valley-right-now" title="Quora Thread" target="_blank">thread</a> today on Quora about the extremely high demand for designers that are capable of designing for the web, whether it be UI, UX, product design, etc., and feel strongly that the main issue is the education designers are receiving. Or in this case, lack thereof.</p>
<p>College programs that don&#8217;t push print design are few and far between, and as a whole look down upon the web industry. While in school, web design was always the back-up plan for those who couldn&#8217;t get a job designing band defaulters or magazines.</p>
<p>Most students don&#8217;t even get a fair shot at exploring web design as an option, as majority of the teachers determining curricula last worked in the field twenty years ago. </p>
<p>The main (and only) &#8220;digital&#8221; course that was taught at my school was Flash, taught by professors who truly believed that flash was relavent enough to teach in 2012, while basic web design was ignored. </p>
<p>So, each year thousands of graduates get in line to be hired by their nearest ad agency, don&#8217;t get a job, and decide there is no career in design. All this while start-ups and web-based creative firms scramble to fill well paying jobs in the web field.</p>
<p>There just isn&#8217;t anyone qualified with enough time teach them all. </p>
<p>Moral of this story? You better jump on <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/#!/exercises/0" target="_blank">codecademy</a>, head to <a href="http://www.skillshare.com/" target="_blank">skillshare classes,</a> or start reading some books. No one is going to teach you.</p>
