copy: As with all Utah trips, we had to get down to Zion as it's just about our favorite place around. It was hovering around 105 degrees so we decided to do a canyon with a relatively short approach and exit and one that we had done before (getting lost in that sun didn't sound terribly fun). We settled on Spry Canyon, a slot right inside the park. <br><br>Spry Canyon is rated 3B III and you'll need a permit from the Zion backcountry office. Once you drive through the Mt. Carmel tunnel, the trailhead is exactly .4 miles down the road. You start up a sandy wash, and after about 15 mins of hiking you can exit the canyon to the right and aim for a pass in between the two biggest features in the skyline. Once you hit the pass you head down and to your left where the canyon begins. There are about 8-9 rappels, depending on what you choose to downclimb or stem, with the longest rappel being the first at 165 feet. You'll need two ropes, or some sort of pull cord system. Depending on the weather there will be a handfull of knee- to chest-deep swims with two very short pockets where we couldn't touch the bottom. We didn't bring wetsuits, and I imagine you wouldn't need them unless it was really cold outside.<br><br> The exit is pretty straightforward. Follow the path of least resistance downhill, where you'll hit your last rappel off an 85 foot cliff band. After that you continue down until you hit Pine Creek. Head up the hill on the other side of of the creek, hit the road again, and hitchhike back to your car! <br><br> <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=z28a7VabHV-8.kHaisYJ62A5A" width="100%" height="500"></iframe>
