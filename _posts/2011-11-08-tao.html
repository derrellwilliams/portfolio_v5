<p><strong>"Well established hierarchies are not easily uprooted; Closely held beliefs are not easily released; So ritual enthralls generation after generation." </strong></p>
<p><strong>Tao Te Ching; 38 Ritual</strong></p>
<p>Recently I was introduced to a fantastic article by John Allsop entitled &#8220;A Dao of Web Design,&#8221; from the all-knowing &#8220;A list Apart&#8221; series. It got me thinking a bit, and I felt inclined to start writing on this blog.</p>
<p>Simply put, the web isn&#8217;t print. Stop designing pages that come from a book and trying to make them into a website. The Internet is an entirely different medium. It is not paper.</p>
<p>Allsop makes the point that when the TV first came out it was dubbed the &#8216;radio picture show&#8217; because people could only connect what it was by relating it to something they already understood. Think of that in terms of the Internet. Why do web buttons have to look like actual buttons from a 1970s laboratory? Because that is what we connect the word button to.</p>
<p>The Internet isn&#8217;t the next step in books, TV, or radio. It is completely different. The Internet provides two-way communication, a way for you to interact with the device. None of the earlier devices do that; they talk, but unlike the Internet, they don&#8217;t listen. </p>
<p>There may be some drawbacks. You can&#8217;t design something entirely in Adobe Illustrator or InDesign and make it an interactive website. Sites display differently in varying browsers. Your favorite typeface might not be a webfont yet. But even with all of that, think of the advantages of not designing for print: never-ending space, responsive design, and the integration of music, video, and animation. Now your daily copy of the NYT isn&#8217;t a constant size but can adapt to the medium that you&#8217;re using to view it.</p>
<p>The great thing about Allsop&#8217;s article is it was written twelve years ago. It&#8217;s now almost 2012 and we haven&#8217;t yet figured out the full potential of Internet. At first it alarmed me that little progress is being made. Then I put it in context with all the other major inventions in history. How long did it take auto makers to go from the Model T to a Toyota Prius (or any other car really, I&#8217;m not a car man)? Or how long did it take us to nail down the printing process from Gutenberg&#8217;s time? The answer is thousands of years. We&#8217;ve only had a solid fifteen years of the public Internet use, and more than half the world&#8217;s populations is without access to it. </p>
<p>We have a long way to go.</p>
