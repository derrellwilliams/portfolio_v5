<h3>sovisit and east harlem</h3>
<p>A couple months ago, Nicole and I were chatting about the lack of an online resource for our neighborhood, East Harlem.  Everything we could find on the neighborhood was either extremely outdated or hard to use. So we decided to build our own little platform to host small community sites to refer people to when they were looking for restaurants, apartments or even the history of a certain neighborhood.  </p>
<p>One of the main reasons we decided to start working on <a href="http://sovisit.us" target="_blank">Sovisit</a>, was the fact that I was reading a handful of books learning basic front-end development, and instead of using the boring homework assignment example pages, I could apply them to a more realistic product.</p>
<p>We also realized that this wasn&#8217;t an entirely novel idea, and that someone could probably get a lot more info out of Craigslist or Foursquare, but the one advantage we have is that anyone crazy enough to build a site for their own neighborhood is probably pretty passionate about it and would have some good hints for someone new to the neighborhood. We think it&#8217;s better advice than a a one-off default on craigslist or review on yelp. I could bring all the loose reviews, apartment listings, and wikipedia defaults to one place.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it! See the site here: <a href="http://sovisit.us" target="_blank">Sovisit.us</a> As I still consider myself a beginner to this code nonsense, feel free to let me know if anything isn&#8217;t working or if you have some advice!</p>
