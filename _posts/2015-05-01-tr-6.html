copy: I was heading down to LA to attend a design conference for Etsy and convinced Nicole to tag along for the weekend before the conference to spend some quality time in Joshua Tree! Our flight got in to LAX a tad late around 1:30 am, but we grabbed a rental car and started the drive east. It took us just less than 3 hours, but by the time we got to Joshua Tree it felt a bit too late to try find a reasonable place to camp in the park. Instead we just parked and slept at the Walmart in Yucca Valley. If you didn't know already, Walmart, while perhaps not the most ethical company, sure does have a cool policy about sleeping in their parking lots. <br><br> The next day we grabbed breakfast at the amazing Joshua Tree Country Kitchen, rented some crash pads from Joshua Tree Outfitters, and headed into the park. We mostly just messed around at the Hidden Valley area and didn't climb terribly hard, but man, it was good to be in the high desert. For a break we took a quick drive around the Cactus garden to see if the cholla were blossoming — they weren't, but it was still a super beautiful part of the park I hadn't been before.<br><br>The next day we woke up and headed towards the Gunsmoke area to mess around and boulder. This was my second Joshua Tree trip that had unseasonably cold weather. I didn't pack particulary well for the cold, but we survived anyway.<br><br>  <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/embed?mid=z28a7VabHV-8.kq3kKM2--bZ0" width="640" height="480"></iframe>
