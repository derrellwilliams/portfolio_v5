copy: Back when I was about a sophmore in high school I had a to do list that mostly included outdoor activities around Utah and hiking Pfeifferhorn was on the list. It only took me about 11 years, but I finally got around to hiking it on our trip to Utah to celebrate Nicole's birthday. At 11,326 of elevation, the hike has about 4000 ft of elevation gain in total and it's about a 9 mile roundtrip. For living at sea level and only arriving in Utah the previous day, we gave ourselves about 4hrs to get to the top with some generous breaks and hanging out. <br><br>The hike starts up Little Cottonwood Canyon at the White Pine parking lot, about 5.5 miles up the canyon, and a mile-ish below Snowbird. It's a pretty chill hike up to the Red Pine Lake and it's after that when things get a bit more exciting. From Red Pine lake you follow a trail up to the ridge that takes you to the Peak. We had setup camp at the Upper Red Pine lake, and we thought it would be easier going up to the ridge/saddle (West of White Baldy) there but it put us on a ridge of 3rd class scrambles with some decent exposure for about 45 mins, when we saw a much easier (although a bit steeper) approach that would have saved us the trouble of the scrambling. Check out the map below to get a general sense of the two options for gaining the ridge.<br><br> After summiting we headed down to the lake where we left our tent and sleeping bags and setup camp. And in the morning it only took us a couple hours to get back down to the White Pine trailhead.<br><br> <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=z28a7VabHV-8.kEncS6a5Q7dU" width="100%" height="580"></iframe>
