copy: I am not much of a biker. I commute everyday and use it to get places, which gets me a chunk of miles each week but I haven't quite seen the appeal of road biking. I get pretty bored on the side of highways just waiting for a car to clip me when the shoulder disappears. So when Dennis suggested we head up to the Gunks and ride around on all the gravel roads, dirt paths, and carriage roads that sounded like a good deal.<br><br> To get there, we took the Metro-North Hudson Line from Grand Central to Poughkeepsie. From the train stop, we headed over the Hudson Walkway bridge and up the rail trail through Highland into New Paltz. Made a quick stop at Rock and Snow, and then started the climb up to the Gunks. We first rode up to Awosting Lake, which had a couple of climbs that were waaaay out of my paygrade and had to walk a hundred yards or so. That being said, the lake was a good reward, had a great rock slab beach all set for swimming and hanging out for lunch.<br><br>We then started our descent and Dennis just about ran over a Timber Rattlesnake. Beside that it was a pretty relaxing descent down a gravel path to Awosting Falls. We then scooted over to the Mohonk Mountain House and headed down Garden Road to Mountain Road which was a freshly paved steep descent that was well worth any of our climbing down into New Paltz again.<br><br> When all was said and done, the days totals came to around 60 miles and 4.5k feet of climbing on dirt & gravel. Which isn't fancy, but wore this commuter out.<br><br>Special love to the <a href="http://ridingthecatskills.com/">Riding the Catskills</a> blog, which helped us figure out where to go.<br><br> <iframe height='505' width='100%' frameborder='0' allowtransparency='true' scrolling='no' src='https://www.strava.com/activities/319868821/embed/c32ee0fcd542da1c156fe27096fb9716ca0fe0e2'></iframe>
