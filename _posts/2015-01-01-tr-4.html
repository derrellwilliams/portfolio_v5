copy: While in Utah this past Christmas we decided to head down to the Robbers Roost with Andrew, Lacey, and Dan. We were looking for a fun intermediate canyon that wasn't going to be wet or deathly cold at the end of December. That got us looking in the Moab, Swell, and Robbers Roost area, and we decided on heading to the North Fork of Robbers Roost. <br><br> Robbers Roost gets it's name from being a hideout for Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and is also one of the most remote areas in the Lower 48. There was about 20 miles of dirt roads to reach the trailhead after already being in the middle of nowhere. <br><br> The canyon proved to hit everything we were looking for, super scenic, some nice rappels, mild approach and exit, and most important of all, dry. We did end up having a bit of snow which complicated things a little bit, but overall was manageable with a bit more partner assist.
