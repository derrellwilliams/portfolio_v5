copy: With rain forecasted over the weekend (and its potential to ruin climbing fun), we decided to head north for the day for some hiking and trail running instead. We’ve spent a decent amount of time exploring sections of Bear Mountain and Harriman State Parks, but just recently read about the trails on Bald Mountain and decided to try them out. <br><br> To get there, we took the Metro-North Hudson Line from Grand Central to Manitou, one of the odd platform train stops on the Metro-North. From the train stop, we followed a few side roads to Route 9W, and used that to lead up to and cross the Bear Mountain Bridge. Once we crossed the bridge, we continued down 9W for a bit to reach the Cornell Mine trail. This section, marked by blue blazes, starts at the roadside and heads up the mountain until near the summit, where it intersects with the Ramapo-Dunderberg trail. If you head right on the Ramapo-Dunderberg trail it puts you out right at the summit, with some pretty solid views of the valley and the bridge.<br><br>The bugs at the summit were ridiculous, so we made a quick escape and headed back down the south side of the mountain. For the descent, we headed right on that Ramapo-Dunderberg trail over and down a few hills until it connected with the 1777 trail (apparently named from the route British soldiers took during the Revolutionary War. History!). Continuing on the 1777 trail we crossed a stream until reaching the remains of Doodletown, a neat deserted village on the mountain that was occupied until the 1960s. There’s not a ton remaining, but signs mark where foundation and wells from the homes and buildings still stand. The path here is flat and essentially a dirt road, and we followed this until it connected with the starting Cornell Mine trail.<br><br>Our time estimates were a bit off and we finished the hike with almost four hours to kill before our return train. We stopped at Hessian Lake, which sits on the way along 9W, and has a big lake with paddle boats and picnic spots. It was a nice place to rest, and a solid place to finish out the day.<br><br>  <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/embed?mid=z28a7VabHV-8.k_r4zsFXLBMQ" width="640" height="480"></iframe>
