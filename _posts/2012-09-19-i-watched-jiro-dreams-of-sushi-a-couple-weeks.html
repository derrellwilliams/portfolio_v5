<p>I watched <a href="http://www.magpictures.com/jirodreamsofsushi/" title="Jiro " target="_blank">"Jiro Dreams of Sushi"</a> a couple weeks ago and it was absolutely inspiring. I loved this quote from Jiro:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>"Once you decide on your occupation&#8230; you must immerse yourself in your work. You have to fall in love with your work. Never complain about your job. You must dedicate your life to mastering your skill. That&#8217;s the secret of success&#8230; and is the key to being regarded honorably."</span></p>
<p><span> – Jiro Ono</span></p>
