<p>While working on some material for &#8220;The Black Power Mixtape&#8221; with Stefania (<a href="http://www.stefania.se" target="_blank">www.stefania.se</a>) I ran across a photo from 1968 of some crazy lettering at a Barber shop I recognized, but instead of &#8220;Your&#8221; it said &#8220;Shabazz&#8221;. After some intense Sherlock work, (ok, maybe it wasn&#8217;t that hard) we saw the remains of &#8220;Shabazz&#8221; below &#8220;Your&#8221;.</p>
