copy: Nicole, Dennis, and I headed up to Vermont this past weekend to do some skiing at Okemo Mountain Resort. It's about a four hour drive from NYC so we started the trek up at about 3am to be ready when the lifts opened at 8am. As our official first ski day of the year, we had pretty great conditions as Vermont was hit with a nice storm a few days prior.<br><br>As we did on our trip up to Okemo last year, we decided that in lieu of paying for a place to stay we would camp on the backside of the resort in the Okemo State Park. We parked at the Healdsville trailhead and hiked about 10-15 mins until we were away from things and setup camp for the night. This same trail continues up the side of the mountain until you reach the Fire Tower at the top of mountain, where you'll find the summit lodge from the resort. I have dreams of camping higher up on this trail and skiing down in the morning, maybe next time. <br><br> You can see a map of where we camped below. <br><br> <iframe src="https://mapsengine.google.com/map/u/0/embed?mid=zl4oK-SSGSOg.kq1W9L8xoDD0" width="100%" height="500"></iframe>
