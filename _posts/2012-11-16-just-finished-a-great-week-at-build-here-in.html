<p><span>Just finished a great week at <a href="http://www.buildconf.com" target="_blank">Build</a> here in Belfast. Have an endless list of things to read, make, and build. More on that later.</span></p>

<p>Katie and I escaped up to the Northern Tip of Ireland today and it was absolutely breathtaking. A palpable history. Stopped at the rope bridge at <a href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/carrick-a-rede/" target="_blank">Carrick-A-Rede</a>, the <a href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/giantscauseway/" target="_blank">Giant&#8217;s Cuaseway</a>, and the original 1608 Bushmills Distillery. </p>

<p>Looking forward to <a href="http://www.bonjournicole.com" target="_blank">Nicole</a> arriving tomorrow, and then we are off to Edinburgh, London, and then Dublin! More photos of the Cuaseway and the rest of the trip to come.</p>
