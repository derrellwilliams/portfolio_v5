copy: With the long Labor Day weekend looming, we headed up for our first Adirondacks experience. We settled on hiking Marcy, mainly becuase it's the highest point in New York. We knew there would be crowds, but holidays don't leave much other choice. We also had my pals from Etsy, Gio and Magera, come along for the trip. Our strategy to avoid some of the crowds was to start late Saturday night, summit in the morning, and then head down early. It mostly worked — we passed lots of people that were coming down on our way up and vice versa for our trip down. <br><br>The trail is about 14.7 miles round trip with an elevation gain of 3300 feet. There are a few established campsites at Marcy Dam and one about mile farther down the trail. As expected these were taken so we continued on the trail until about mile 4 where we found a decently even place to setup our tents. Not the best, but not the worst camping situation we've had.<br><br>The real treat of this hike is getting above the treeline towards the summit. I hadn't been on a peak on the east coast that gets high enough for this, and it was a beautiful alpine-like enviroment. We got to the top and watched the fog roll in, hung out for a bit, and then headed down. <br><br><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=z28a7VabHV-8.kNyE8aVqVGYQ" width="100%" height="500"></iframe>
