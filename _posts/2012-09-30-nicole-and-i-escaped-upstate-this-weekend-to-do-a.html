<p>Nicole and I escaped upstate this weekend to do a bit of camping and hiking. It had been awhile since we have had any outdoor adventures and decided it was a computer free weekend. (Not camera free or iPhone free as you can see. We aren&#8217;t crazy.) So we headed to our nearest section of the Appalachian Trail and it felt great. Turns out it&#8217;s a lot more peaceful than Harlem.</p>
<p>If you are in the City, Metro North has a stop right at a trailhead on the weekends. Do it.Â </p>
