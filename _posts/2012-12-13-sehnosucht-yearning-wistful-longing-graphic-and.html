<h3>Sehn•sucht: yearning; wistful longing</h3>
<p><span>Graphic and web design are great, but sometimes you get a good case of the </span><em>sehnsucht’s</em><span> (a fancy new german word I learned and am probably using incorrectly). I&#8217;ll be the first to admit that even with all the &#8220;building&#8221; I do on the Internet, sometimes I get the ol’ </span><em>sehnsucht’s</em><span> to build real-life physical things. </span></p>
<p>Like when my pop bought his first house. Saying he bought it isn&#8217;t entirely truthful, because all he bought at the time was the land. The house didn&#8217;t exist yet. He had decided to build that on his own. He&#8217;d never built a house before and I imagine had never before built anything even close to that scale. A few weeks ago I asked him how he learned and he said, “I spent my life watching your grandpa build things. If you have a desire to build things it&#8217;ll make sense.”</p>
<p>He ended up just getting started, renting a backhoe to dig the foundation, and setting all the footings himself. The part that really got to me and my little Adobe CS6 thinking brain, was when I asked how he managed to lift the logs up to the top of house without more equipment.</p>
<p>"Oh, your grandpa and I rigged up a crane using block and tackle," he said. "We just hoisted them up." Right. He just came up with a handmade rig to lift up huge 40 ft. tall logs to the top of a two-story cabin.</p>
<p><span>But my Pop probably views designing and developing a website the same way as I do about coming up with a homemade crane to lift logs to the top of a house. And that&#8217;s really what I&#8217;m &#8220;wistfully-longing&#8221; for, to be able to bridge that gap in my lifetime; building things on the Internet while simultaneously building goods in the physical world. The best of both worlds.</span></p>
