<h3>then and now</h3>
<p>I have been doing some research for the past couple weeks for a personal project Nicole and I are working on, and we have found a handful of really cool photos of East Harlem in the 1930s. Today I got the urge to run around with about 15 of these old photos and try and track down where they were located (The older photos are courtesy of nycgov.com).</p>
<p>I got a little overzelous and was showing them to a few employees of these businesses, and needless to say, the people working at these stores weren&#8217;t nearly as excited as I was. The owner at the Euromex Soccer store was the most interested but when I told him his store used to be a funeral/embalming business, he didn&#8217;t seem all that excited anymore.Â </p>
