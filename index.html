        <p>Urban Compass (Now known as Compass, after thier national expansion) is a full end-to-end service for helping people find a home they love. The company was founded in late 2012 and I joined the team as the first full-time product designer in early 2013, about 4 months before the public launch of the company. I began concepting the product and creating wireframes with our head of product as we flushed out the problems we were trying to solve, as well as how we were going to approach the very complex and political real estate space in New York City. By September 2013, Urban Compass received its Series A funding, valued at $150 million. Throughout the next year we tested and iterated our original ideas, basing changes on the company's evolution and research, to better the product and user experience.</p>

          <h3 class="mt2 mb0">The Homepage</h3>
          <p class="mt1 mb3">The Urban Compass homepage was one project that was constantly evolving. As we updated features and adjusted our positioning we had to keep the messaging clear, and the user flow simple and to the point. The balance of new users understanding the product, while still getting them to sign up use the product, was always a main priority. A few iterations of the home pages are shown above.</p>

            <h3 class="mt2 mb0">Scheduling Tool</h3>
            <p class="mt1 mb3">An early feature that I concepted and designed was the online scheduling tool. I created a four-step process to get the required information from users to our agents. One of the challenges of working for Urban Compass was that I always had to keep three groups in mind: the user, the agent, and the landlord. All three were crucial in the end goal of renting an apartment, so it was always important that the process was simple for everyone involved.</p>

            <h3 class="mt2 mb0">Search Tools</h3>
            <p class="mt1 mb3">One of the more intricate parts of the product was allowing users to search our listing inventory, and providing them with the best possible content before they got in touch with our agents. Building a template that could respond to the myriad listing variations of listings was tricky — some listings had good photos and some didn’t, some had features listed and some didn’t. To accommodate every situation we had to build a page that would withstand all of those changes while maintaining shape and hierarchy. Above are the search and listing pages we created.</p>

        <p>A while back, my wife, Nicole, and I were chatting about the lack of online resource for our then-neighborhood of East Harlem. Everything we could find on the neighborhood was either extremely outdated or hard to use. We decided to build our own little platform to host small community sites. </p>
        <p>The first neighborhood that we built under Sovisit was East Harlem, where we lived at the time. We really felt that it was an underated neighborhood with an amazing history that wasn't as much press or time as it's neighbors, Central and West Harlem. It also gave us a chance to talk to our neighbors and local business owners. Meeting them and photographing their businesses was one of my favorite parts of the project, and getting to know the people behind the "digital" side of the product made it that much more fulfilling when we started seeing them share their photos and pages with friends.</p>

          <p>A project that stemmed from a collaboration with the Nashville-based country music duo, Drew and Lacey.

Each session will be different: a new mix of musicians, a brand new song, an old bluegrass standard that we just rediscovered, or a 10-minute long fiddle jam. No tracks, no studios, just a song the way you would hear it if you were there." </p>
